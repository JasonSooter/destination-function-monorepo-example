# Fetch the Segment Public API token from AWS Secrets Manager and export it for
# the deploy steps. Requires temporary AWS credentials to already be present in
# the environment — supplied by the aws-assume-role-with-web-identity Buildkite
# plugin, whose IAM role is allowed to read this secret.
#
# The token is the only secret a deploy needs, and it is shared across all
# environments. Each function's per-environment Segment function ID is committed
# in functions/<name>/function.json, since a function ID is an identifier rather
# than a credential and is useless without this token.
#
# Sourced (not executed) so the export lands in the calling shell:
#   source .buildkite/fetch-secrets.sh
